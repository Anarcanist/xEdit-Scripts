# xEdit-Scripts
Quick automation of tasks in xEdit for Bethesda games.

For now none of these are going to have any user interface; they're simple enough they don't need it, and frankly I don't have the energy to install another IDE and get more familiar with the API.

# Current Scripts
Fallout 4 - ImageSpace Tool
  - Simple set of parameters for tweaking Fallout 4's version of ImageSpaces, since a few things changed from Skyrim.
  
# Installation
Just copy the Edit Scripts folder and merge it with the one in your game's root directory (where it's installed.)

# Future Plans
Scripts regarding game balance, NPC flags and values, and leveling are probably up next unless something else with my weather mod necessitates automation.
